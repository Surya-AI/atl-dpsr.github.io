# Wecome to ATL dpsr
ATL is an approach of Central government of India to create an environment of scientific temperament, innovation, creativity amongst Indian Students. It is a step towards a new India.

Since the last few decades, our education system has seen a paradigm shift. Today, with this approach of inculcating Hands on Methodology in the current education scenario we have resolved the need of the hour.

ATL lab would teach students essential 21st-century skills which will help them in developing their professional and personal skills. Skilled India is the need of the hour and each step taken this dream should be welcomed and we should work towards it together for a better India.

ATL dpsr is just a small part of a larger government scheme **Atal Innovation Mission** by the NITI Ayog. We conduct weekly workshops and competitions every year to keep up with the innovative ideas of the children. Fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/CygDguNNFMdjK6od8) to join us.
